    "description": "In August 2012, for the First Year Anniversary at our Tap Room and Restaurant, we decided to take two of our favorite Dust Bowl beers…Galaxy Pale Ale and Son of Wrath Double IPA…and formulate a new IPA recipe using elements from both beers. The result was a delicious, bold IPA with the fruity, citrus character and malt backbone of Son of Wrath, as well as the tropical aroma and easy drinkability of Galaxy Pale. It was so popular with our fans, we decided to brew more.",

      "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",
